# Some ideas

- generator for full paradigms and (under-)specified morpholgical descriptions; would make comparison with http://www.pledarigrond.ch/rumantschgrischun/?locale=rm

- thourough coverage analysis with additional corpora

- include the already created word lists

- create fsm-based tokenizer

- produce variants for other Rumansh variants

- produce spell checker user foma med

- add cgflookup-based desambiguator (alternative to wapiti desambiguator)
